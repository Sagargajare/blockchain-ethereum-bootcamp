# The Kickstart/CrowdCoin App

This README is for my version of the Kickstart/CrowdCoin app developed in the udemy.com course [Ethereum and Solidity: The Complete Developer's Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/ethereum-and-solidity-the-complete-developers-guide/). For this app I used the latest version of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) when I created this repo, and this is now being updated to the currently latest version of Next.js (**v12**) as part of my current efforts to bring this repo up-to-date. So bear with me as I work towards completing this upgrade over the next week.
